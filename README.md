# Project Description
This project is a backend web API built with .NET Core, a cross-platform, open-source framework for building web applications. It's implemented with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, a design pattern used to organize code in a way that separates concerns. Additionally, the project utilizes GraphQL, a query language for APIs that allows for more flexible and efficient data retrieval, and Banana Cake Pop, a library that provides GraphQL support for .NET Core. The API likely provides the functionality for the client application to access the data and perform operations on it using GraphQL, and it is built with the help of Banana Cake Pop library.
